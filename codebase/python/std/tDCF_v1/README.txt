A MATLAB code package for computing t-DCF and EER metrics for ASVspoof2019.
(Version 1.0)

USAGE:
Run evaluate_tDCF_asvspoof19.m to compute the metrics as follows:

	evaluate_tDCF_asvspoof19(CM_SCOREFILE, ASV_SCOREFILE)

where 

  CM_SCOREFILE points to your own countermeasure score file.
  ASV_SCOREFILE points to the organizers' ASV scores.
  
  NOTE! There are two different ASV score files provided by the organizers:
        One for the physical access scenario and the other for the logical access scenario.
